# TextEncryptionUsingStreamCipherAndSteganography
 Text Encryption app Using Stream Cipher and Steganography developed by using Python

###Text Encryption app Using Stream Cipher and Steganography

##Task

Build an application that can be used for hiding a secret message with a plain text using stream cipher for encrytion.

##Summary 

This application was built using Python. It is a very easy programming language to use for developing a basic application, which allows user to easily install libraries needed. Thus, this app was implemented using Python for both the main functionality and front-end part.

##Functionality

This application allows the users to input a secret message and a plain text, then the program will encrypt the secret message using stream cipher and hide it within the plain text. People cannot see the secret message after hiding and they cannot obtain the original message without the key. Only receiver can see the original message by inputting the message to the program for decryption.

##Design

The design of this app consits of two main parts which are module for encryption by taking a secret message and a plain text from the users and module for decryption which will take the message after encryption for decrypting it with the key.
